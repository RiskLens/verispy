  "summary": "A nurse says a long list of social security numbers were mistakenly mailed to workers.  Current and former workers received the mailing last week.  What people assumed was, routine mail, actually stunned some recipients.  Stephen Miller, of Bridgemark Healthcare, apologized for the clerical error that resulted in approximately 800 plan participants receiving the list with all 800 social security numbers clearly visible.  In a written statement he says,  All impacted individuals are being enrolled in a comprehensive identity theft protection program, in addition to credit monitoring and fraud alert services, at no cost to them.  This coverage is retroactive to the mailing date and will extend for multiple years.  Well stay in touch with the folks at Bridgemark Healthcare about their promise to protect workers.   If you think your identity has been stolen, contact the U. S. Postal Inspector.  Keep in mind, its tedious to regain once its stolen, so safeguard your social security number at all times.",
