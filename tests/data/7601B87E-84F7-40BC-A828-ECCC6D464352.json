  "summary": "Bit9, a company that provides software and network security services to the U.S. government and at least 30 Fortune 100 firms, has suffered an electronic compromise that cuts to the core of its business: helping clients distinguish known safe files from computer viruses and other malicious software. But earlier today, Bit9 told a source for KrebsOnSecurity that their corporate networks had been breached by a cyberattack. According to the source, Bit9 said theyd received reports that some customers had discovered malware inside of their own Bit9-protected networks, malware that was digitally signed by Bit9_s own encryption keys.",
